## **About Myself**
I am a third year computer engineering student with a passion to solve real world problems with code. As was a child, I was intrigued by websites/computer software and when I was introduced to Python, I got hooked on it. Since then I have learned multiple programming languages, tech stacks , technologies and built multiple projects with them.
